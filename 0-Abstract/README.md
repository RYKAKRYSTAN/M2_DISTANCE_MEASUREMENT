***ABSTRACT***<br/>
            This project uses an ultrasonic senor(Hd44780) to measure distance with ATmega 328 microcontroller.The sensor works in such a way that the sensor sends an ultrasonic 
          pulse if any object is being sensed the pulse bounces back to the sensor.Ultrasonic sensors are a great solution for the detection of clear objects.  For liquid level 
          measurement, applications that use infrared sensors, for instance, struggle with this particular use case because of target translucence.
